# task-data-processing
The project probably is not runnable without the necessary input-data and input-plugins, which I did not commit due to data protection/privacy reasons.
I decided to make the project public anyway so it can serve as a reference of what I programmed in my spare time.

## Possible evaluations
- Responsibilities:
    - Tasks in a group at a given moment (day?) in time
    - Tasks being moved into or out of a certain group (fixed moment and range)
- Tasks being created or closed
    - At a given moment in time
    - During a given time range
    - For a certain task type
